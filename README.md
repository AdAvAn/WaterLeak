*Finished WaterLeak Controller v1.0 device*

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Water leak monitoring** in 2 zones with automatic closure of water supply valves when triggered in any zone
- **Valve control** for hot and cold water (open/close) on demand (via buttons or web interface)
- **Temperature monitoring** of hot water and heater using DS18B20 sensors (display output on screen and web)
- **Heater management** with power state control (via buttons or web interface)
- **LCD display** with RGB backlighting for system status display. Different colours for various situations
- **Audio signals** for notifications and emergency situations
- **Web interface** for remote monitoring and control (simple interface without authentication)
- **RTC module** for precise timekeeping and scheduled events
- **WiFi connectivity** to existing network with automatic reconnection
- **State storage system** with saving to device non-volatile memory

## üîÆ Development Plans

1. **Add code for controlling a 3rd valve** that manages hot water supply based on central supply status. If hot water supply temperature is normal (45-60 degrees), the water heater is switched off and water is supplied from the central system. If central water supply temperature drops below 30¬∞C, automatically switch off central supply and switch to heater using the 3rd valve. All necessary components are already included in the schematic, but the code has not been written.

2. **Heater control** based on temperature sensor feedback

3. **Automatic heater shutdown** during night hours for energy conservation

4. **Energy-saving mode** based on DS3231 chip alarm functionality, which has its own battery. Implementation: controller wake-up ‚Üí sensor polling ‚Üí shutdown

5. **Add authentication** to web interface

6. **Add 3rd contact (feedback)** to PCB for leak sensor to monitor connection status. This functionality was omitted during the design stage and became critical during installation, as the system cannot independently verify if the sensor is connected, preventing the controller from alerting about sensor cable breaks

## üìã Requirements

### Hardware

- **Microcontroller:** Raspberry Pi Pico W
- **Display:** LCD1602 (WSLCD1602RGB 16x2 LCD with RGB backlighting, I2C)
- **RTC:** DS3231 (real-time clock module, I2C)
- **Temperature sensors:** DS18B20
- **Leak sensors:** simple contacts (2 units)
- **Valves:** motorised 12V valves (2 units), tested with Neptun Bugatti Pro 12V 1/2"

> **Note:** The system can operate without the LCD1602 display, temperature sensors, water heater, and WiFi network connection.

### Hardware Features

**Heater control** is performed through a relay managed by the Pi Pico via a transistor and PC817C optocoupler, providing isolation of the high-voltage module from the rest of the PCB. The board includes a fuse to prevent short circuits in the heater power supply circuit. The reverse side of the board has contacts that need to be soldered to ensure higher current capacity for the heater.

**Power supply:** The board requires external 12V power supply. This voltage powers the controller through a regulator and directly powers the valves.

**Indication:** The system includes LED indicators (optional for installation) for additional indication of actual voltage supply to valves. Whilst voltage is supplied to a valve, the indicator will illuminate.

**Valve control:**
- Voltage supply to valves is performed through an Infineon BTS721L1 chip, which includes protection systems and feedback contacts for convenience (feedback contacts are connected to the controller, but code for them has not been written)
- For heater valve control, two Infineon BTS452TATMA1 chips are used: one for closing, another for opening

**Water leak sensors** consist of two contacts (preferably implemented using stainless steel), connected to an S9018 transistor (with circuitry protecting against interference and false triggers). This arrangement provides a higher quality signal and protects the controller contact from direct connection to the sensor, thereby improving reliability. The transistors have good amplification coefficients, giving the sensors excellent sensitivity.

**RTC chip** receives and stores current time using an NTP server, which can be configured in the settings file. The chip contains its own CR-1220 battery to maintain current time. Additionally, the chip is connected to a separate pin 14 of the controller for interaction with the built-in alarm (refer to DS3231 datasheet), allowing additional tasks such as energy-saving mode by switching off the controller, timed heater shutdown mode, etc.

**Enclosure and mounting:** The PCB is designed for installation in an enclosure ([AliExpress link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007104359147.html)). Component sizes on the board are designed to allow soldering with a standard soldering iron, though using a hot air station is much more convenient. Sensors, buttons, and all external indicators connect to the board through HDR-M-2.54_1x3 connectors and others, but direct soldering is also possible.
